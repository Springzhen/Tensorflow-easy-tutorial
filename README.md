### Tensorflow-easy-tutorial

This project contains the common demo of how to using tf  in nlp and also contains some basic operation

my main idea is “the simpler the better” and everyone can understand.

#### Demo list
* "tensorflow+RNN的使用讲解.ipynb" This file show us the different between dynamic rnn and static rnn and also gives the detail of  how to transfor batch of sentences index with embedding matrix , explain the tensor shape change procedure. 

* 'NER.ipynb' This notebook shows a easy instance of how to use ner with tensorflow and it is easy for redesign.
